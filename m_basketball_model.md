### Basketball Model
We applied the model developed for soccer to basketball. The mehtodology is the same and is described in detail [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/akhilketkar/am207-project-soccer/blob/master/Models/basketball_model.ipynb). Points scored by each team are treated as a Poisson process. They are the equivalent of goals in the model for soccer.
