\section{Introduction}
Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, particularly in Europe. The 
popularity of the sport combined with the legal status of gambling has led
to the formation of a very deep and active betting market for soccer. A
number of different bookmakers allow people to bet large sums of money 
on various aspects of the game. One can obviously bet on the outcomes
of games but also other scenarios like the score at half-time, number of 
penalties, etc. The objective our project is to find actionable inefficiencies in the 
soccer betting market. 

% \paragraph{Outline}
%The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
%Section~\ref{previous work} gives account of previous work.
%Our new and exciting results are described in Section~\ref{results}.
%Finally, Section~\ref{conclusions} gives the conclusions.

\section{Previous work}\label{previous work}
A fair amount of work has been done in this area. But it pales in comparison
to the amount of research done on American sports, especially baseball.
The most important work for the purposes of our project is the Dixon-Coles
1997 paper \cite{dixoncoles}. 

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}
Dixon and Coles propose a bayesian model that uses a bi-variate Poisson 
distribution for number of goals scored by each team. We will use this model 
as the basis of our inquiry and improve upon it as needed. In particular we might 
look at  differences in scoring in the first half of a game compared to the second half, 
the effect of yellow and red cards, the effect of multiple games within the same
week, of injuries to certain players, of coaches etc.

\par 
We will train the model on available data and then use 
MCMC methods to sample from the distributions of the model parameters. Finally
we will test the model against bookmakers' odds to see if they can be systematically
beaten. 

\section{Data}\label{data}
The data we will use for this project will primary come from the various divisions of
English Football focusing on the Premier League which is the top tier of competition.
Although one might suspect the betting market in smaller teams to be less efficient. 
The data comes from the website Football Data \cite{football-data} which has data for
all divisional games for multiple years along with the bookmakers odds for each game.
