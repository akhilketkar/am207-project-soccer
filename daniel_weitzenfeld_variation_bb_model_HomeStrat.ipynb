    "\n",
    "Number of goals scored by home team in game g is denoted by $y_{home}^{(g)}$. The number of goals scored by the away team in game g is denoted by $y_{away}^{(g)}$. The $y$'s are assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with an unknown rate parameter.\n",

    "$$ y_{home} | \\theta_{home} \\sim Poisson(\\theta_{home}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_{away} | \\theta_{away} \\sim Poisson(\\theta_{away}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate parameter is assumed to depend on some underlying ability of each time. In the definitions below $h(g)$ denotes the home team for game g and $a(g)$ denotes the away team.\n",

    "$$ log (\\theta_{home}) = home + intercept + att_{h(g)} + def_{a(g)} $$\n",

    "\n",

    "$$ def_t \\sim N(0,1 / \\tau_{def}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model defines non-informative hyper priors on $\\tau$, $home$ and $intercept$\n",

    "The intercept term here represents the mean scoring ability of each team. But we don't believe the mean scoring ability is the same for all teams. So we modify the model to incorporate this prior knowledge. We split teams into $k$ classes based on their position in the league table last year, their total payroll or some such measure. For now, I use their position in the table last year and split the table in $k$ = 3 groups: top third, middle third and bottom third. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept for each of these $k$ groups is allowed to differ in our new model. Let $c(t)$ be the function that maps a team $t$ to it's class as defined above. Then we change\n",

    "$$ log (\\theta_{home}) = home_t + intercept_{c(h(g))} + att_{h(g)} + def_{a(g)} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ intercept_m \\sim N(0,1000) $$\n",
